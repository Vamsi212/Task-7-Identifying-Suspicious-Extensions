## 📚 Learnings

- **Check permissions** like “Read and change all your data on websites” — it’s a red flag.
- Malicious extensions can **steal passwords**, **inject ads**, and **track browsing activity**.
- Always install from **trusted developers** and **official stores**.
- Keep the number of extensions to a minimum to improve performance and reduce attack vectors.
